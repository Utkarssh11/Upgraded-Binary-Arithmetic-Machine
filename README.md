## About our project 📝

Language and Tools: Python 🐍, GUI: Tkinter 🖥️ (the standard GUI library for Python)

The Upgraded Binary Arithmetic Machine is a project focused on binary format operations and conversions. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform various mathematical operations on binary numbers.

The project includes the following tasks:

1. Conversions:
   - Decimal Conversion
   - Binary Conversion
   - Octal Conversion
   - Hexadecimal Conversion

2. Binary Operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

3. 1's and 2's Complement

4. Binary Left and Right Shift

5. Binary Encryption and Decryption

6. Bitwise Operators:
   - AND operator
   - OR operator
   - XOR operator

## Future Scope 🚀

In the future, we have plans to enhance the project with the following features:

- Algorithm to handle floating decimal values in operations and conversions.
- Support for scientific calculations such as speed of light, gravity, logarithm, and antilogarithm.
- Integration of security features for advanced calculations.
